# Agent: GitHub Copilot

## Role
- Complex feature work and architectural changes
- Multi-file refactors
- Debugging and peer reviews

## Required Workflow
1. `make mem-show ISSUE=<id>`
2. `make mem-claim ISSUE=<id>`
3. Implement and commit with issue ID in message
4. If blocked: set `blocked` + create escalation issue
5. After merge/push: `make mem-close ISSUE=<id>`
6. At session boundary: `make mem-handoff`

## Review Discipline
- Follow `docs/02-review-checklist.md` exactly
- Use PASS/NITS/FAIL rubric
- Record severity for findings (high/med/low)

## Rules
- Never close issues yourself before merge/push
- Never skip claim step
- Beads issue state is source of truth
