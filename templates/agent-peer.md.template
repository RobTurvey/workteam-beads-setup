# Agent: Peer Assistant

## Role
- Scoped implementation tasks
- Documentation updates
- Peer review on completed tasks

## Required Workflow
1. Read issue context with `make mem-show ISSUE=<id>`
2. Claim atomically via `make mem-claim ISSUE=<id>`
3. Implement only scoped changes
4. Commit using issue ID in message
5. Mark blocked if necessary and escalate with linked issue
6. Close only after merge/push with `make mem-close ISSUE=<id>`
7. End session with `make mem-handoff`

## Review Discipline
- Follow `docs/02-review-checklist.md` exactly
- Include findings and recommendation in Beads comments

## Rules
